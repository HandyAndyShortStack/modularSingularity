modularSingularity
==================

This project was an attempt to break modular functionality out of singularity chess with a view to creating a framework for generating graphical examples of piece movement for use in documentation.  I have since decided that singularity chess just needs a complete rewrite, but this repository remains unmerged as a reference to me when I decide to tackle the project.
